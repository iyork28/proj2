I chose to write this assignment in Ruby. 

In case whomever is reading this is unfamiliar with Ruby, simply install ruby and bundle and run 'bundle'. This will install the gems that I used, which can be seen in my Gemfile.

I wrote this for Ruby 2.1.1, but I believe that most everything should work in older ruby versions.

To run, execute:

> ruby main.rb [torrent_file]

Honestly, I didn't quite get the writing to file part to work, but it will create a couple of blankish files in whatever directory you execute the code in... Sorry about that!

Thanks!
